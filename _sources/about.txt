About Us
========

HoloViews is part of the `IOAM <https://github.com/ioam>`_, 
the Github organization for the Computational Systems 
Neuroscience Group at the University of Edinburgh. We are
member of the Edinburgh `Doctoral Training Center 
<http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/dtc/>`_ which is part of the 
`Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation <http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/>`_.

When we are not working on HoloViews, we are computation neuroscientists
working on large-scale models of the mammalian visual system. We are also
developers of the `Topographica neural simulator <https://ioam.github.io/topographica/>`_
which we mostly use to build computational models of the primary visual cortex (V1).

**Jean-Luc Stevens :** PhD candidate at the Edinburgh DTC investigating 
the temporal dynamics of V1 activity response.

**Philipp Rudiger :**  PhD candidate at the Edinburgh DTC investigating anatomically 
realistic models of V1 development and how this relates to natural image statistics.

**James A. Bednar:** Associate Professor and Director of the DTC researching biologically
realistic computational modeling of human and animal visual systems.
