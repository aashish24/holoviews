HoloViews Tutorials
*******************

The HoloViews tutorials are the best way to learn what HoloViews can
do and how to use it..  The web site has static copies of each
tutorial, but it is much more effective to install HoloViews and try
it out live for yourself, using the notebook files in
``doc/Tutorials/*.ipynb`` in the HoloViews distribution.

The explanatory tutorials are meant to be viewed and worked through in
this order:

* `Showcase: <http://ioam.github.io/media/holoviews/Showcase.html>`_
  Brief demonstration of what HoloViews can do for you and your data.

* `Introduction: <http://ioam.github.io/media/holoviews/Introduction.html>`_
  How to use HoloViews -- basic concepts and getting started.

* `Exploring Data: <http://ioam.github.io/media/holoviews/Exploring_Data.html>`_
  How to use HoloViews containers to flexibly hold all your data
  ready for selecting, sampling, slicing, viewing, combining, and
  animating.

* `Transforming Data: <http://ioam.github.io/media/holoviews/Transforming_Data.html>`_
  How to transform data within HoloViews containers, e.g. by
  collapsing across dimensions. (Coming soon!)

At any point, you can look through these more comprehensive but less
explanatory overview tutorials that list each of the objects
available:

* `Elements: <http://ioam.github.io/media/holoviews/Elements.html>`_
  Overview and examples of all HoloViews element types, the atomic items
  that can be combined together.

* `Containers: <http://ioam.github.io/media/holoviews/Containers.html>`_
  Overview and examples of all the HoloViews container types.

* `Pandas and Seaborn: <http://ioam.github.io/media/holoviews/Pandas_Seaborn.html>`_
  Using HoloViews with the external Pandas and Seaborn libraries.

There is also a reference tutorial explaining the details of the
support offered for working with real-world data:

* `Continuous Coordinates: <http://ioam.github.io/media/holoviews/Continuous_Coords.html>`_
  Support for continuous coordinates offered by HoloViews.

For more detailed information on any component described in the
tutorials, please refer to the `Reference Manual:
<../Reference_Manual>`_ or the online help (e.g. type ``Image?`` in an
IPython Notebook cell).
