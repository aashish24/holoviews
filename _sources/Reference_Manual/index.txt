Reference Manual
****************

This reference manual contains detailed documentation of each
component making up DataViews, assuming that the user is already
familiar with basic DataViews usage. (See the `Tutorials`_ for such
an introduction.) The reference manual is
generated directly from documentation and declarations in the source
code, and is often much more verbose than necessary, because many
little-used yet often-duplicated methods are listed for each class.
Still, the reference for a given component does provide a
comprehensive listing of all attributes and methods, inherited or
otherwise, which is difficult to obtain from the source code
directly and is not covered by the User Manual or Tutorials.
